## General Information
This project is about predcting the factors that influence stroke. The training dataset contains a total of 43400 entries with 12 columns, 10 independent variables(age, gender, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, hypertension, heart disease, ever_married, bmi), smoking_status) and 1 target variable(stroke).  
The aim was to predict the factors influencing stroke.

## Technologies
* Python 
* Jupyter Notebook

* The project used the following packages:
* pandas (import pandas as pd)
* numpy (import numpy as np)
* seaborn (import seaborn as sns)
* matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
* Scikit-learn

## Results
After training the data using a Random Forest Classifier Algorithm, I determined the the most important features. Then, I predicted the target variable(stroke) for the test data using the model built.
